# FoodStoreApp


The Food store app was made back in the foundations program at the apple developer academy. Me and 2 other teammmates design the page layouts and the colorscheme. I decided to add additionaly functionality by adding an accountSettings page and a locationpage which I utlized the Mapkit features that I learned. This project goes over the swift and swift ui basics. I was able to create a inventory and cart struct which help with the functionality of the app.
