# 01 OverView
The Food store app was made back in the foundations program at the Apple Developer Academy which lasted for a month. Me and 2 other teammmates design the page layouts, colorscheme, and inteded functionality we wanted our app to do. I decided to add additionaly functionality by adding an accountSettings page and a locationpage which I utlized the Mapkit features that I learned. This project goes over the swift and swift ui basics. I was able to create a inventory and cart struct which help with the functionality of the app.

#02 Test
10/30/22
I recently learned about the Retain Cycle and various ways to check for memory leaks. I decided to double check the objects in my project using the memory map and running the simulation to detech any possible memory leaks. Fornatuately there was no memory leaks to the best of my knowledge.
